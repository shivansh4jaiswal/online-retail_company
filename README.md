OnlineRetailDB â€“ SQL Project
Project Overview:
OnlineRetailDB is a fictional online retail database system built on Microsoft SQL Server. It simulates the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform, including customer management, product cataloging, order processing, inventory tracking, sales reporting, audit logging, and database security controls.

Database Structure:
Customers: Stores customer information and contact details.

Products: Catalog of products with price, stock, and category mapping.

Categories: Defines product categories with descriptions.

Orders: Records customer orders with order date and total amount.

OrderItems: Line items of an order with quantity and purchase price.

ChangeLog: Captures inserts, updates, and deletes through triggers for auditing.

Features:
Relational Schema with primary/foreign keys and constraints for data integrity.

Sample Data Insertion for realistic testing and demonstration.

SQL Queries: 40+ queries for analytics, KPIs, and reporting use cases.

Triggers: Automatic audit logging for data changes.

Indexes: Clustered and non-clustered indexes for improved performance.

Views: Simplified query access for common reporting needs.

Security: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with roles, users, and permission management.

Skills Demonstrated:
Writing advanced SQL queries (joins, subqueries, aggregates, CTEs, window functions).

Database design and normalization with constraints and relationships.

Implementing triggers for automated auditing of transactions.

Index optimization for performance tuning.

Creating views for reusable and readable reporting.

Managing security and permissions using RBAC.

Translating business requirements into database logic.

Usage Instructions:
Run all provided SQL scripts in sequence on Microsoft SQL Server.

Load the included sample data to simulate e-commerce activities.

Explore the queries and views for insights into sales, inventory, and customers.

Test the audit logging by performing insert, update, and delete operations.

Experiment with role-based access to enforce permissions.

Extend or customize the schema and queries to fit additional use cases.
